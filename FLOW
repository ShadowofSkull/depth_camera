1. Run the nodes ros2serial_gripper and motor to communicate to the arduino gripper and motor. 
2. Run astra camera node 

1. The camera should detect ball distance, and send x / z coordinate to the motor_control topic. Where the motor ino will read and move towards it. 
2. The IR sensor from gripper ino will detect if ball is in the gripper, then it will flip. 
3. Then camera need to detect silo, with distance, then send x,z command to move towards it. Once the ultrasonic detect <50, it will stop and send the command o to open the gripper and flip 
4. Then the robot repeats the loop of looking for the ball and move towards the ball, then IR sensors will detect ball is in gripper again.
