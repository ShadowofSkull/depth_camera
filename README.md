## Introduction
This guide captures the knowledge acquired while using a depth camera with ROS and Linux during Robocon 2024. It is designed to help beginners get up to speed with the basics of ROS, Linux, depth cameras, and more.

## Important Concepts
- **ROS Basics**: Learn to navigate the ROS environment, including setting up packages, nodes, and topics.
- **Linux Command Line**: Master essential Linux commands like `ls`, `cd`, `grep`, and `chmod` that are frequently used in ROS workflows.
- **Depth Camera Setup**: Understand how to connect and configure depth cameras in a ROS environment, including troubleshooting common issues.
- **OpenNI and OpenCV**: Explore the usage of OpenNI for depth sensing and OpenCV for image processing, and how they integrate with ROS.
- **Python Scripting in ROS**: Learn how to write Python scripts that interact with ROS nodes, process depth data, and handle camera outputs.
- **Virtualisation for ROS**: Quick development when software or hardware takes time to setup

## Tips
- **Experiment**: Donâ€™t hesitate to try different commands and scripts. Break things to learn how to fix them.
- **Ask Questions**: Use online communities like ROS Answers or Stack Overflow if you get stuck.
- **Document Everything**: Keep a log of what you learn, including mistakes and how you solved them.


## Additional Resources
- **ROS Wiki**: The [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/) is your go-to resource for tutorials and documentation.
- **Linux Command Cheat Sheet**: Keep a [Linux command cheat sheet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/) handy to speed up your workflow.

## Conclusion
This guide is a stepping stone for beginners to build a solid foundation in ROS, Linux, and depth camera usage. Keep learning, experimenting, and don't be afraid to dive deeper into more advanced topics as you become more comfortable.
